# Decision_Tree_Analysis

This decision tree analysis compares the cost-effectiveness of surgical and non-surgical treatments for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries. ACL is a critical ligament within the knee joint that provides knee stability, and its rupture is a common injury among young and athletic individuals. The study aims to determine the short-term and long-term costs associated with surgical and non-surgical treatments and if age and type of treatment impact the rehabilitation of ACL injury. The population studied consists of patients who have undergone reconstructive surgery for ACL repair or opted for conservative rehabilitation options. The data was collected from published medical literature, and the decision tree model was administered over a 90 months period. The study provides patient-level analysis, including the total direct costs of treatment, healthcare system costs, productivity costs, and direct non-medical costs, as well as facility-level analysis that includes cost-utility results of early reconstruction versus rehabilitation plus optional reconstruction. The results show that while surgical reconstruction is more expensive than non-surgical treatment, it has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life due to an unhealed ACL injury.

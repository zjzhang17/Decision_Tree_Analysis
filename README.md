# Decision Tree Analysis with Rational Will

This decision tree analysis compares the cost-effectiveness of surgical and non-surgical treatments for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries. ACL is a critical ligament within the knee joint that provides knee stability, and its rupture is a common injury among young and athletic individuals. The study aims to determine the short-term and long-term costs associated with surgical and non-surgical treatments and if age and type of treatment impact the rehabilitation of ACL injury. The population studied consists of patients who have undergone reconstructive surgery for ACL repair or opted for conservative rehabilitation options. The data was collected from published medical literature, and the decision tree model was administered over a 90 months period. The study provides patient-level analysis, including the total direct costs of treatment, healthcare system costs, productivity costs, and direct non-medical costs, as well as facility-level analysis that includes cost-utility results of early reconstruction versus rehabilitation plus optional reconstruction. The results show that while surgical reconstruction is more expensive than non-surgical treatment, it has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life due to an unhealed ACL injury.

# Results and Conclusion

The decision tree model considers the treatment options for an ACL injury: surgery or rehabilitation. The surgical branch has two outcomes: Successful and Not Successful, with probabilities of 0.707 and 0.293, respectively. The cost of successful surgery is $9926, while the cost of repeat surgery is $19852. The utility value for a successful surgery is 1, while that for a not successful surgery is 0.5. The rehabilitation branch also has two outcomes: Successful and Not Successful, with probabilities of 0.497 and 0.503, respectively. The cost of successful rehabilitation is $2535, while the cost of unsuccessful rehabilitation plus surgery is $12461. The utility values are the same as those for surgery. The maximum cost of treatment is $50,000, and the maximum willingness to pay is $20,000. Using the QALY formula (Utility * Time), the QALYs for surgery and rehabilitation are 0.854 and 0.749, respectively. The ICERs for surgery and rehabilitation are $50,538.48 and $10,057.15, respectively. Therefore, according to this decision tree model, rehabilitation is the treatment of choice.
